% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\) 
\abstract{Radio-frequency (RF) tomographic imaging is a promising technique for inferring multi-dimensional physical space by processing RF signals traversed across a region of interest. Tensor based approaches for tomographic imaging are superior in detecting the objects within higher dimensional spaces. The recently proposed tensor sensing approach based on the transform tensor model achieves lower error rate and faster speed than previous tensor-based compress sensing approach. However, the running time of the tensor sensing approach increases exponentially with the dimension of tensors, thus not very practical for big tensors. In this paper, we address this problem by exploiting massively parallel GPUs. We design, implement and optimize the tensor sensing approach on an NVIDIA Tesla GPU  and evaluate the performance in terms of the running time and recovery error rate. Experiment results show that our GPU tensor sensing is as accurate as the CPU counterpart with an average of $44.79 \times$ and up to $84.70 \times$ speedups for varying sized synthetic tensor data. For ground-truth 3D model data of smaller size, our GPU algorithm achieves 15.37x speedup over the CPU tensor sensing. We further encapsulate the GPU algorithm into an open-source library, called \textit{cuTensorSensing}, which can be used for efficient RF tomographic imaging.}

\section{Introduction}

\end{figure}
Radio frequency (RF) tomographic imaging, also called wireless tomography, is a technique for detecting objects within a specific region by analyzing radio frequency signals transmitted between wireless nodes, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:RF}. This technique uses radio reflections that bounce off the object body and does not require the object to carry any wireless device. This advantage has made it ideal for security checking, rescue operations, space applications, and smart buildings \cite{matsuda2017multi}.

In general, wireless signal propagating on a link loses power due to shadowing, distance and multipath fading. The task of RF tomographic imaging is to estimate a spatial distribution of the shadowing loss in a detecting region from measured power of wireless signals. A tensor-based compressed sensing method \cite{matsuda2017multi} was proposed for RF tomographic imaging in a three and higher dimensionally structured region, which estimates the distribution by utilizing its low-rank property. However, the method requires computing tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) in each algorithmic iteration, which leads to high computational complexity. To address this problem, Deng et al. \cite{deng2018tensor} proposed to use the transform-based tensor model to formulate the RF tomographic imaging as a tensor sensing problem, then use a fast iterative algorithm Alt-Min to solve the tensor sensing problem. Their method fully utilizes the geometric structure of the three-dimensional loss field tensor. Compared to the tensor-based compressed sensing method, Deng's method achieved lower error rate and faster computation speed.

However, the iterative algorithm Alt-Min proposed by Deng et al.\cite{deng2018tensor} iteratively estimates a pair of tensors, which is a computationally-intensive process, thus not very practical for RF tomographic imaging for big objects or regions, or real-time applications. In this paper, we address this problem by exploiting Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Because of massive hardware parallelism and high memory bandwidth, GPUs have been widely used in diverse applications including machine learning \cite{cui2016geeps} \cite{brito2017detecting} \cite{campos2017scaling}, graph processing \cite{shi2018frog} \cite{zhong2017optimizing} \cite{pan2017multi}, big data analytic \cite{gutierrez2017smote} \cite{rathore2017real}, image processing \cite{devadithya2017gpu}, and fluid dynamics \cite{verma2017advanced}. In order to reap the power of GPUs, the algorithmic steps need to be mapped delicately onto the architecture of GPUs, especially the thread and memory hierarchy.  In this work, we design, implement and optimize the transform model based tensor sensing method of Deng et al. \cite{deng2018tensor} on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU with CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and evaluate it in terms of the running time and recovery error. Experiment results show that the GPU algorithm achieves similar relative error as the CPU counterpart. Moreover, the GPU tensor sensing outperforms the CPU tensor sensing on all tensor sizes with 45.39x speedup on average and up to 84.70x speedup on bigger tensor size such as $120 \times 120 \times 6$. We encapsulate this GPU tensor sensing algorithm into an open-source library called ``cuTensorSensing" (CUDA Tensor Sensing) which is available at: http://www.findai.net.

Our contributions are summarized as follows. First, we analyze the steps of transform model based tensor sensing using the Alt-Min algorithm and discuss how to map them onto the GPU architecture. Second, we design, implement and optimize the tensor sensing on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Third, we evaluate and compare the GPU tensor sensing and the CPU tensor sensing in terms of running time and relative error with both synthetic data and ground-truth data. Fourth, we encapsulate the GPU tensor sensing implementation into an open-source library such that it can be used in diverse applications.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{SEC_RW}, we discuss the related works. Section \ref{SEC_ALGORITHM} presents the notations and briefly summarizes the RF tomographic imaging task as a tensor sensing problem. Section \ref{SEC_GPU} describes the design, implementation and optimizations of the tensor sensing on the GPU. In Section \ref{SEC_EXP}, we describe the experiment methology. Section \ref{SEC_RESULT} evaluates the GPU tensor sensing with both synthetic data and ground-truth data. The conclusions are given in Section \ref{SEC_CON}.

\section{Related Works}
\label{SEC_RW}
Existing works on RF tomographic imaging can be classified into vector-based and tensor-based approaches. The vector-based approaches \cite{kanso2009compressed} \cite{mostofi2011compressive} aim at estimating a spatial distribution of the shadowing loss in 2D regions of interest. They are not able to infer three-dimensional regions due to the fact that spatial structures of the signal data are ignored. Therefore, researchers have proposed the tensor-based approaches \cite{matsuda2017multi} \cite{deng2018tensor} to infer higher dimensional spaces of 3D and above. The tensor-based compressed sensing \cite{matsuda2017multi} used tensor nuclear norm (TNN) \cite{li2013generalized} to extend RF tomographic problems to three-dimensional case. This approach has high computational complexity and error rate. Deng et al. \cite{deng2018tensor} exploited the transform-based tensor model \cite{liu2017fourth} to explore three-dimensional spatial structures for higher accuracy and speed. Our work aims at accelerate Deng's work on GPUs to make it practical for real-time scenarios and bigger tensors.

GPUs have massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, and many existing researches \cite{jing2016energy} \cite{zhang2015buddy} \cite{zhang2015efficient} \cite{zhang2014cuirre} \cite{zhang2016efficient} have demonstrated the benefit of utilizing GPUs to accelerate general purpose computing. Due to the high dimensions of tensors, tensor computations are often computation-intensive and time consuming. Recently, GPUs have been increasingly adopted to accelerate diverse tensor computations. Some works focus on accelerating specific tensor operations including tensor contraction \cite{nelson2015generating} \cite{shi2016tensor}, factorization \cite{antikainen2011nonnegative}, transpose \cite{lyakh2015an} \cite{hynninen2017cutt}, and tensor-matrix multiplication \cite{rogers2016efficient}. These works propose parallel tensor algorithms specifically optimized for the GPU architectures. GPUTENSOR \cite{zou2015gputensor} is a parallel tensor factorization algorithm that splits a tensor into smaller blocks and exploits the inherent parallelism and high-memory bandwidth of GPUs. To handle dynamic tensor data, GPUTENSOR updates its previously factorized components instead of recomputing them from the raw data. Sparse tensor-times-dense matrix multiply is a critical bottleneck in data analysis and mining applications and \cite{li2016optimizing} proposed an efficient primitive on CPU and GPU platforms. Different with these works, our work considers the tensor sensing based on the transform tensor model for RF tomographic imaging.

\section{Notations and the Tensor Sensing Problem}
\label{SEC_ALGORITHM}
Deng et al. \cite{deng2018tensor} proposed to use the transform-based tensor model to formulate the RF tomographic imaging as a tensor sensing problem. Then they utilized a fast iterative algorithm Alt-Min to solve the tensor sensing problem. Here we briefly summarize their approach including the Alt-Min algorithm in order to map it onto the GPU architecture.

\subsection{Notations and the Transform-based Tensor Model}
We use lowercase boldface letter $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1}$ to denote a vector, uppercase boldface letter $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times N_2}$ to denote a matrix, 
and calligraphic letter $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3}$ to denote a tensor. $[k]$ denotes the set $\{1,2,\dots, k\}$. Let $\mathcal{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3}$ 
denote a third-order tensor. $\mathcal{A}(:,j,k)$, $\mathcal{A}(i,:,k)$, $\mathcal{A}(i,j:)$ denote mode-1, mode-2, mode-3 tubes of $\mathcal{A}$, and $\mathcal{A}(:,:,k)$, $\mathcal{A}(:,j,:)$ $\mathcal{A}(i,:,:)$ 
denote the frontal, lateral, and horizontal slices. The Frobenius norm of $\mathcal{A}$ is defined as $\|\mathcal{A}\|_F = \sqrt{\sum ^{N_1}_{i = 1} \sum ^{N_2}_{j = 1} \sum ^{N_3}_{k = 1} \mathcal{A}^2_{ijk}}$.
The operator vec(.) transforms tensors and matrices into vectors. Let $\mathbf{X}^{T}$ and $\mathcal{A}^{\dagger}$ denote the transposes of a matrix and a tensor, respectively.
\begin{defn}\cite{liu2017fourth}
    Given an invertible discrete transform $\mathcal{L}:\mathbb{R}^{1\times 1 \times N_3} \to \mathbb{R}^{1\times 1\times N_3}$, the elementwise multiplication $\circ$, and $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times 1\times N_3}$ , the tubal-scalar multiplication is defined as:
        \begin{equation}
            \mathbf{a} \bullet \mathbf{b} = \mathcal{L}^{-1}(\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{a})\circ \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{b}))
        \end{equation}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}\cite{liu2017fourth}
    The $\mathcal{L}$-product $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{B} \bullet \mathcal{C}$ of $\mathcal{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times r \times N_3}$ and $\mathcal{C} \in \mathbb{R}^{r\times \times N_2 \times N_3}$ is a tensor of size $N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3$, where $\mathcal{A}(i,j,:) = \sum^r_{s=0}\mathcal{B}(i,s,:)\bullet \mathcal{C}(s,j,:)$, for $i \in [N_1]$ and $j \in [N_2]$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}\cite{liu2017fourth}
    The transform domain singular value decomposition $\mathcal{L}$-SVD of $\mathcal{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3}$ is given by $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{U} \bullet \mathcal{S} \bullet \mathcal{V}^{\dagger}$, where $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are $\mathcal{L}$-orthogonal tensors of size $N_1 \times N_1 \times N_3$ and $N_2 \times N_2 \times N_3$ respectively, and $\mathcal{S}$ is a diagonal tensor of size $N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3$. The entries of $\mathcal{S}$ are called the singular values of $\mathcal{A}$, and the number of non-zero ones is called the $\mathcal{L}$-rank of $\mathcal{A}$.
\end{defn}

\subsection{The Tensor Sensing Problem}

The loss field tensor$\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{X}^{N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3}$ with $\mathcal{L}$-rank $r$ is what we want to reconstruct. We make the RF signal measurement $M$ times, and let $\mathbf{y}_m$ denote the value of the $m$-th RF signal measurement and the sensing tensors is denoted by $\mathcal{A}_m \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3}$. Then we have:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{y} = \sum\limits_{{n_1,n_2,n_3}}\mathcal{A}_m(n_1,n_2,n_3)\mathcal{X}(n_1, n_2, n_3)+w,
\end{equation}
where $w$ is the noise.
With a linear map $\mathcal{H}(\cdot):\mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3} \to \mathbb{R}^M$\cite{jain2013low} and the vector $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3}$ made by $M$ RF signal measurements $\mathbf{y}_m$ \cite{kong2014data}. We get:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{y} = \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{X}) + \mathbf{w},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{w}$ denotes the noise vector. This problem can be formulated as a low $\mathcal{L}$-rank tensor sensing problem:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqa:lstm}
    \widehat{\mathcal{X}} = \mathop{\arg\min}_{\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3}}  \| \mathbf{y} - \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{X}) \|_F^2 , \\ 
    \text{s.t.} \text{rank}(\mathcal{X}) \leq r .
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Solving the Tensor Sensing Problem with the Alt-Min Algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\setstretch{2}
    \caption{Alt-Min: AM($\mathcal{H}(\cdot), \mathbf{y}, r, L$)}
    \label{alg:AM}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
        \Require
        linear map $\mathcal{H}(\cdot)$, measurement vector $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathcal{L}$-rank $r$, iteration number $L$.
        \State Initialize $\mathcal{U}^0$ randomly;
        \For{$\ell = 1$ to $L$} 
            \State $\mathcal{V}^{\ell} \gets \text{LS}(\mathcal{H}(\cdot), \mathcal{U}^{\ell -1}, \mathbf{y}, r)$
            \State $\mathcal{U}^{\ell} \gets \text{LS}(\mathcal{H}(\cdot), \mathcal{V}^{\ell}, \mathbf{y}, r)$
            \EndFor
        \Ensure: Pair of tensors ($\mathcal{U}^L, \mathcal{V}^L$).
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[htb]
\setstretch{2}
    \caption{Least Squares Minimization: LS($\mathcal{H}(\cdot), \mathcal{U}, r, \mathbf{Y}$)}
    \label{alg:LS}
    \begin{algorithmic}[2]
        \Require
        linear map $\mathcal{H}(\cdot)$, tensor $\mathcal{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1\times r \times N_3}$, measurement vector $\mathbf{y}$, $\mathbf{L}$-rank $r$.
    \State \[
    \widehat{\mathcal{V}} = \mathop{\arg\min}_{\mathcal{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times N_2 \times N_3}}\| \mathbf{y} - \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{U} \bullet \mathcal{V}) \|_F^2 , 
    \]
    \Ensure tensor $\mathcal{V}$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Alg.\ref{alg:AM} shows how the alternating minimization algorithm works on the tensor sensing problem. The target tensor is represented as the $\mathcal{L}$-product of two smaller tensors, i.e., $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{U} \bullet \mathcal{V}$, $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3}$, $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times r \times N_3}$ and $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times N_2 \times N_3}$.
Then equation \eqref{eqa:lstm} can be reformulated as following:
\begin{equation}
    \widehat{\mathcal{X}} =
    \mathop{\arg\min}_{ \mathcal{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1 \times r \times N_3}, \mathcal{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times N_2 \times N_3}}\| \mathbf{y} - \mathcal{H}(\mathcal{U} \bullet \mathcal{V}) \|_F^2 , \\
\end{equation}
The key step is the least squares (LS) minimization, as shown in Alg. \ref{alg:LS}. The detailed implementation of LS minimization are summarized as follows.

We use the circulant algebra \cite{liu2016low} \cite{gleich2013power} to perform the $\mathcal{L}$-product. The operator circ($\cdot$) denotes mapping circulants to their corresponding circular matrices which are tagged with the superscript $c$, i.e. $\underline{\alpha}^c, \underline{\mathbf{A}}^c$:
\[
    \underline{\alpha}^c = \text{circ}(\underline{\alpha}) = \begin{bmatrix}
        \alpha_1 & \alpha_{N_3} & \cdots  & \alpha_2 \\
        \alpha_2 & \alpha_1 & \cdots & \cdots \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \alpha_{N_3} \\
        \alpha_{N_3} & \alpha_{N_3-1} & \cdots & \alpha_1
    \end{bmatrix}
    \],
    \[
        \underline{\mathbf{A}}^c = \text{circ}(\underline{\mathbf{A}}) = \begin{bmatrix}
            \text{circ}(\underline{\mathbf{A}_{1,1}})  & \cdots & \text{circ}(\underline{\mathbf{A}}_{1,N_2)}) \\
            \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
            \text{circ}(\underline{\mathbf{A}_{N_1,1}})  & \cdots & \text{circ}(\underline{\mathbf{A}}_{N_1,N_2)}) \\
        \end{bmatrix}
        \].

For simplicity, we use $\mathbf{A}^c$ to represent the circular matrix of tensor $\mathcal{A}$. Then the $\mathcal{L}$-product $\mathcal{X} = \mathcal{U} \bullet \mathcal{V}$ has an equivalent matrix-product as:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{X}^c = \mathbf{U}^c\mathbf{V}^c,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{X}^c \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1N_3\times N_2N_3}$, $\mathbf{U}^c \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1N_3\times rN_3}$, $\mathbf{V}^c \in \mathbb{R}^{rN_3\times N_2N_3}$. Then the LS minimization in Alg.\ref{alg:LS} can be transformed to the corresponding circular matrix representation:
\begin{equation}
    \widehat{\mathbf{V}}^c = 
    \mathop{\arg\min}_{ \mathbf{V}^c \in \mathbb{R}^{rN_3 \times N_2N_3}} \| \mathbf{y} - \mathcal{H}^c(\mathbf{U}^c\mathbf{V}^c) \|_F^2 , \\
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}^c(\cdot): \mathbb{R}^{N_1N_2 \times N_2N_3} \to \mathbb{R}^M$ is the corresponding linear map in the circular matrix representation, with $\mathbf{y} = \mathcal{H}^c(\mathbf{X}^c)$. Each sensing tensor $\mathcal{A}_m$ is transfomed into its circular matrix $\mathbf{A}^c_m \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1N3 \times N_2N_3}$, and $\mathbf{y}_m = \langle \mathbf{X}^c, \mathbf{A}^c_m \rangle$, $1 \leq m \leq M$. Similarly, $\mathbf{U}^c$ can be estimated in the follow way:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqa:8}
    \widehat{\mathbf{U}}^c =
    \mathop{\arg\min}_{ \mathbf{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{rN_3 \times N_2N_3}} \| \mathbf{y} - \mathcal{H}^{cT}(\mathbf{U}^c\mathbf{V}^c) \|_F^2 . \\
\end{equation}


\subsubsection{Optimization of Alt-Min}
In circular algebra, it is obvious that the first column of $\underline{\alpha}^c$ contains all the entries of itself, so it is no need to recover the redundant information. We only need to recover the first column of each circ($\underline{\mathbf{X}}_{i,j}$). We use the Matlab function squeeze($\cdot$)  to get a new definition:
\[
    \mathbf{X}^s = \begin{bmatrix}
        \text{squeeze}(\mathcal{X}(1,1,:)) & \cdots & \text{squeeze}(\mathcal{X}(1,N_2,:)) \\
        \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \text{squeeze}(\mathcal{X}(N_1,1,:)) & \cdots & \text{squeeze}(\mathcal{X}(N_1,N_2,:))
    \end{bmatrix}
\],
where squeeze$(\mathcal{X}(i,j:))$ transforms the $i$-th tube of the $j$-th lateral slice of $\mathcal{X}$ into a vector of size $N_3 \times 1$.

We use the notation $\Leftrightarrow$ to denote a new mapping for $\mathcal{L}$-product as follows:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{X} = \mathcal{U}\bullet \mathcal{V} \Leftrightarrow \mathbf{X}^s = \mathbf{U}^c\mathbf{V}^s,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{X}^s \in \mathbf{R}^{N_1N_3 \times N_2}$, $\mathbf{U}^c \in \mathbf{R}^{N_1N_3 \times N_3}$, $\mathbf{V}^s \in \mathbf{R}^{rN_3 \times N_2}$. Then the LS minimization in Alg. \ref{alg:LS} can be transformed to the following representation:
\begin{equation}
    \widehat{\mathbf{V}}^s = 
    \mathop{\arg\min}_{ \mathbf{V}^s \in \mathbb{R}^{rN_3 \times N_2N_3}} \| \mathbf{y} - \mathcal{H}^s(\mathbf{U}^c\mathbf{V}^s) \|_F^2 , \\
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}^s(\cdot):\mathbb{R}^{N_1N_3\times N_2} \to \mathbb{R}^{M}$ is the corresponding linear map, with $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{H}^s(\mathbf{X}^s), \mathbf{y}_m = \langle \mathbf{X}^s, \mathbf{A}^s_m \rangle$, $1 \leq m \leq M$.
Similarly, the $\mathbf{U}^c$ can be estimated in the following way:
\begin{equation}
    \widehat{\mathbf{U}}^c = 
    \mathop{\arg\min}_{ \mathbf{U}^c \in \mathbb{R}^{N_1N_3 \times rN_3}} \| \mathbf{y} - {\mathcal{H}^s}^T({\mathbf{U}^c}^T{\mathbf{V}^s}^T) \|_F^2. \\
\end{equation}

Alg.\ref{alg:LS} shows the tensor sensing approach with optimization of Alt-Min.

            \EndFor
        \State $\mathbf{X}^s = \mathbf{U}^c\mathbf{V}^s$
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Implementation on CPU}
We perform the following steps to solve the non-convex optimization problem in main step in Alg.\ref{alg:TS}(line 3 and line 4):
\begin{steps}
\item $\mathbf{U}^c$ is used to form a block diagonal matrix $\mathbf{B}_1$ of size $N_1N_2N^2_3 \times rN_2N^2_3$, and the number of $\mathbf{U}^c$ is $N_2N_3$,
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eqa:diag}
        \mathbf{B}_1 = 
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \mathbf{U}^c & & & \\
            & \mathbf{U}^c & & \\
            & & \ddots & \\
            & & & \mathbf{U}^c
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
\item Stack all the columns of $\mathbf{V}^c$, and then $\mathbf{V}^c$ is vectorized to a vector $\mathbf{b}$ of size $rN_2N_3N^2_3 \times 1$ as following:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathbf{b} = \text{vec}(\mathbf{V}^c) =[\mathbf{V}^c(:,1)^T, \mathbf{V}^c(:,2)^T, \dots, \mathbf{V}^c(:,N_2N_3)^T]^T. 
    \end{equation}

\item Each $\mathbf{A}^c_m$, $1 \leq m \leq M$ is represented as a vector $\mathbf{c}_m$ of size $N_1N_2N^2_3 \times 1$ in the following way:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathbf{c}_m = \text{vec}(\mathbf{A}^c_m) \\
        =[\mathbf{A}^c_m(:,1)^T, \mathbf{A}^c_m(:,2)^T, \dots, \mathbf{A}^c_m(:,N_2N_3)^T]^T.
    \end{equation}

    And then all the $\mathbf{c}_m$ are transfomed into a matrix $\mathbf{B}_2$ of size $M \times N_1N_2N^2_3$:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathbf{B}_2 = [\mathbf{c}_1, \mathbf{c}_2, \dots, \mathbf{c}_M]^T
    \end{equation}
    Therefore, the estimation of $\mathbf{V}^c$ is transformed into the following standard least squares minimization problem:
        \begin{equation}
            \label{eqa:lsm}
            \widehat{\mathbf{b}} =
            \mathop{\arg\min}_{ \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{rN_2N^2_3 \times 1}} \| \mathbf{y} - \mathbf{B}_2\mathbf{B}_1b) \|_F^2 .
        \end{equation}

\end{steps}
We use pseudo code(Alg.\ref{list:pseudocode}) with some Matlab api to demonstrate the implementation of tensor sensing on CPU.

\section{The Implementation and Optimization of Efficient GPU Tensor Sensing}
\label{SEC_GPU}
%psuado code
To achieve high performance on GPUs, we need to consider the data representation, the mappings from computations to GPU threads, and memory accesses. We first design a basic GPU tensor sensing implementation, then optimize the implementation to further improve performance.

\subsection{Design and Implementation of the GPU Tensor Sensing}
\subsubsection{Data Struct}
In Alg. \ref{list:pseudocode}, after least squares minimization (lines 4 and 10 in Alg. \ref{list:pseudocode}), we get vectorized matrices. For a matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, the corresponding vectorized $\mathbf{A}$ is $\mathbf{A}_v \in \mathbb{R}^{mn \times 1}$. And the vectorized matrices are converted back to the original matrices (lines 5 and 11 in Alg. \ref{list:pseudocode}). In some scientific computing programming languages, such as Matlab, this conversion must be done with the appropriate conversion function.
We adopt the column-first storage format to store matrices and vectors, which not only ensures read and write continuity but also avoids explicit vector-to-matrix conversions since vector $\mathbf{A}_v$ and matrix $\mathbf{A}$ in memory are the same in this format, as shown in Fig. \ref{Fig:vec2mat}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{vec2mat.png}
\caption{Vectorize a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ into vec($\mathbf{A}$) in memory}
\label{Fig:vec2mat}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Least Squares Minimization}
As shown in Alg. \ref{list:pseudocode}, least squares minimization (LSM) is the major step of the tensor sensing approach, which is the most time-consuming part of the entire approach. There are many approaches to perform least squares minimization. QR factorization is one of the most efficient approaches, which is well supported by CUDA. The least squares problem can be formulated as:
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{\mathbf{x}} = \mathop{\arg \min}_{\mathbf{x}} \| \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} \|^2_F,
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{A}$ is a matrix of size $m \times n$, $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector
of size $k \times 1$, and $\mathbf{b}$ is a vector of size $n \times 1$. In the tensor
sensing, the system we work on is an overdetermined system, where $n >
 k$.
 We perform QR factorization on $\mathbf{A}$ and get $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{Q}\mathbf{R}$ , where $\mathbf{Q}$ is an
 orthogonal matrix of size $n \times k $ and $\mathbf{R}$ is an upper triangular matrix of size $k \times k$. Taking advantage of the special nature of these matrices we obtain $\mathbf{x}$
as following:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{R}^{-1}\mathbf{Q}^{T} \ast \mathbf{b}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Optimizations of the GPU Tensor Sensing}
\label{SEC_OPT}
\subsubsection{Optimizing Multiply of Block Diagonal Matrices}
Using the operational properties of the block matrix we get:
\begin{equation}
        [\mathbf{A}_1, \mathbf{A}_2, \cdots, \mathbf{A}_{N_2}]
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \mathbf{U}^c & & & \\
            & \mathbf{U}^c & & \\
            & & \ddots & \\
            & & & \mathbf{U}^c
        \end{bmatrix}
        =
        [\mathbf{A}_1\mathbf{U}^c, \mathbf{A}_2\mathbf{U}^c, \cdots, \mathbf{A}_{N_2}\mathbf{U}^c]
\label{step1}
\end{equation}
It shows that multiplication of block diagonal matrices can be transformed into a batch of small matrix multiplications. As we use column-first format to store $\mathbf{A}$, the batch of $\mathbf{A}_i$ are stored in constant stride. Let $p$ indicate the location of the first element of $\mathbf{A}_0$, then the location of the first element of $\mathbf{A}_i$ is $p+i\times N_1N_3$.  We utilize the gemmStridedBatchd() routine in NVIDIA cuBLAS Library to compute a batch of matrix multiplications simultaneously to achieve better performance.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{diagMM.pdf}
\caption{Multiplication of block diagonal matrices on GPU}
\label{Fig:diagMM}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}
\caption{The parameters of the gemmStridedBatchd() routine in the cuBLAS library.}
\label{tab:gemm}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Parameters & Meaning & Value \\
\hline
transA & operation op($\mathbf{A}$) that is non- or transpose & non-transpose \\
\hline
transU & operation op($\mathbf{U}$) that is non- or transpose & transpose \\
\hline
$\mathbf{A}$ & pointer to the $\mathbf{A}$ matrix corresponding to the first instance of the batch & $d_A$ \\
\hline
$\mathbf{U}$ & pointer to the $\mathbf{U}$ matrix & $d_y$ \\
\hline
$\mathbf{W}$ & pointer to the $\mathbf{W}$ matrix & $d_W$ \\
\hline
strideA & the address offset between $\mathbf{A}_i$ and $\mathbf{A}_{i+1}$ & $M\times N_1N_3$ \\
\hline
strideU & the address offset between $\mathbf{U}_i$ and $\mathbf{U}_{i+1}$ & 0 \\
\hline
strideW & the address offset between $\mathbf{W}_i$ and $\mathbf{W}_{i+1}$ & $M\times N_3$ \\
\hline
batchNum & number of $gemm$ to perform in the batch & $N_2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Eliminating Explicit Transpose Operations}
After each least squares method, the transpose of the target matrix is obtained. The transpose operation of the matrix needs to be performed (lines 7 and 12 in Alg. \ref{list:pseudocode}). However, the transpose operation takes a lot of computing time and resource. As the operation after transpose of the matrix is multiplication of diagonal matrices, we eliminate explicit matrix transpose by enabling the transpose option in the gemmStridedBatched() routine. In this way, the gemmStridedBatched() routine will perform matrix transpose implicitly and efficiently before the matrix multiplications. 

\subsection{Data Reusing Strategy}
During the computation flow of the GPU tensor sensing, frequent data transfer between the CPU and GPU will significantly degrade system performance. Therefore we design data reusing  strategy to reduce data transfer overhead and resource consumption.

In the entire tensor sensing flow, we envoke data transer only twice at the beginning and in the end. At the beginning, the input data is transferred from the CPU to the GPU. In the end, the final result matrix is sent back to the CPU. We optimize the computations in the tensor sensing flow such that they all perform in-place calculations. For instance, in the QR decomposition to solve the least squares problem, the input vector $\mathbf{y}$ is overrode by the result vectors (vec($\mathbf{U}$) and  vec($\mathbf{V}$)). Therefore, we need to reassign the vector $\mathbf{y}$ at the beginning of each least squares minimization iteration. However, it is an expensive operation to load the original data of vector $\mathbf{y}$ from the CPU memory every time. Instead, we pre-allocate a memory space named  $dyL$ on the GPU that stores the original data of the vector $\mathbf{y}$. Every time we need to reassign the $dy$, we use the GPU device to device transfer routine cudaMemcpyDeviceToDevice() to copy the data from $dyL$ to $dy$. Since the device to device bandwidth $~380 GB/s$ is much higher than the bandwidth between the CPU and GPU $~12 GB/s$, this strategy significantly reduces data transfer overhead. Alg.\ref{alg:GPU} describes the computation flow of the tensor sensing on the GPU.

\section{Experiment Methodology}
\label{SEC_EXP}
In this section, we describe the experiment methodology including the hardware and software platform, testing data, testing process, and the comparison metrics.

\subsection{Hardware and Software Platform}
We use an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU to evaluate the performance of GPU tensor sensing. The GPU incorporates 5120 CUDA cores @ 1.53 GHz and 32 GB DDR5 memory. It is installed on a server with 128 GB DDR memory and an Intel i7-7820x CPU with 8 cores @ 3.60 GHz supporting 16 hardware threads with hyperthreading technology. The server is running Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with the kernel version 4.15.0. The CPU and GPU tensor sensing is running with Matlab R2017b and  CUDA 10.0, repectively.

\subsection{Testing Data}
In the experiment, we use both synthetic and ground-truth data in the evaluation. The synthetic data is generated according to the compressed sensing model \cite{matsuda2017multi}. For ground-truth data, we use the IKEA 3D data (\ref{Fig:chair}) that generates a ground truth tensor of size $40 \times 40 \times 6$ with $\mathcal{L}$-rank 1.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{chair.png}
\caption{The 3D visualizations of an IKEA chair model.}
\label{Fig:chair}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Testing Process}
The synthetic and real data are processed by the CPU tensor sensing implementation in Matlab and GPU tensor sensing implementation in CUDA, respectively. We evaluate and compare two versions of GPU tensor sensing: the unoptimized one and the optimized one. The unoptimized GPU tensor sensing adopts none of the optimization techniques in Sec. \ref{SEC_OPT}.  We repeat each experiment five times and report the average results.

\subsection{Comparison Metrics}
We adopt two metrics for comparison: running time and relative error rate.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Running time:} varying the tensor size and fixing other parameter, we measure the execution time of the CPU tensor sensing, unoptimized GPU tensor sensing and optimized GPU tensor sensing. Finally we calculate speedups as the running time of the CPU tensor sensing divided by the running time of GPU tensor sensing.
    \item \textit{error rate:} we adopt the metric relative square error, defined as $ RSE = \| \widehat{\mathcal{X}} - \mathcal{X} \|_F / \|\mathcal{X} \|_F $.
\end{itemize}

    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tbl_runtime}
\end{table}

Fig. \ref{pic:runtime} shows that the running time of the CPU tensor sensing and two GPU tensor sensing implementations (unoptimized and optimized ones) for $\mathcal{X}$ of size $n\times n \times 6$ of $\mathcal{L}$-rank 1, where $n$ varies from 40 to 120 at a step of 20. The sampling rate is set to 20\%, and both CPU and GPU tensor sensing iterate 5 iterations for completion. The detailed time value is listed in Table \ref{tbl_runtime}. 
While $M = N_1 \times N_2 \times N_3 \times \text{sampling rate}$ and $\mathcal{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{M \times N_1N_2N_3}$, the scale of the main operation matrix $\mathcal{A}$ increases at a rate of four times as the increase rate of $n$. 

We can see that the running time of the CPU tensor sensing is polynomial with the increase of $n$, while the running time of the GPU tensor sensing is linearly growing. The unoptimzed and optimized GPU tensor sensing achieved an average of $4.24 \times$ and $44.79 \times$ and up to $9.77 \times$ and $84.70 \times$ speedups, respectively. This illustrates the effectiveness of the optimization methods proposed in Sec. \ref{SEC_OPT}. When the tensor size is small, the data transfer occupies a major portion of the entire execution time of the unoptimized GPU tensor sensing. As a result, its performance is even lower than the CPU tensor sensing.

\end{figure}

This experiment evaluate the error rate of the CPU and GPU tensor sensing under different iterations for $\mathcal{X}$ of size $40 \times 40 \times 6$ with $\mathcal{L}$-rank 1. The sampling rate is set to 50\%. The running time of the CPU tensor sensing at 5 iterations is 14.91 seconds on average, while the running time of the GPU tensor sensing is 0.97 second on average, thus the speedup is $15.37 \times$. As shown in Fig. \ref{pic:rse}, under increased iterations from 1 to 30, the RSEs drop significantly. More importantly, the CPU tensor sensing and GPU implementation achieve almost the same RSEs at all iterations ( the two curves in Fig. \ref{pic:rse} overlap with each other), which means that they achieve similar error rate performance in tensor sensing.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{SEC_CON}
In this work, we present an open-source library named \textit{cuTensorSensing} for efficient RF tomographic imaging on GPUs. The experiment evaluations show that the proposed GPU tensor sensing works effectively and accurately. Compared with the counterpart on CPU, the GPU tensor sensing achieves similar error rate but much faster speed. For synthetic data, the GPU tensor sensing achieves an average of $44.79 \times$ and up to $84.70 \times$ speedups versus the CPU tensor sensing for bigger tensors. For ground-truth 3D objects data of smaller tensor size, the GPU tensor sensing achieves a $15.37 \times$ speedup over the CPU tensor sensing. The cuTensorSensing library is useful for efficient RF tomographic imaging.

%The appendix is an optional section that can contain details and data supplemental to the main text. For example, explanations of experimental details that would disrupt the flow of the main text, but nonetheless remain crucial to understanding and reproducing the research shown; figures of replicates for experiments of which representative data is shown in the main text can be added here if brief, or as Supplementary data. Mathematical proofs of results not central to the paper can be added as an appendix.

%\section{}
%All appendix sections must be cited in the main text. In the appendixes, Figures, Tables, etc. should be labeled starting with `A', e.g., Figure A1, Figure A2, etc.
